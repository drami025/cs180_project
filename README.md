# Description
Our Project is the Tinder App, or 'YouWho'. The project is currently in development and this README.md will be updated with the later features and functions list
that our team has implemented for the milestones.

Milestone 0

1. User should be able to signup and login through Facebook. A Facebook account is required to login where an option to make an account is given.  A username and password is required to login.[Done]

2. Each user will have profile preferences with name, sexual preference, distance, age range.[Done]

Milestone 1

1.An anonymous group chat. This chat is completely anonymous and does not show anyone’s YouWho profile.[in progress, Aaron]
